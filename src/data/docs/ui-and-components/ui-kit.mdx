# UI Kit

The UI Kit contains a collection of interactive elements commonly used to build web applications. Examples include buttons, text inputs, dropdowns, select boxes, and more.

<br />

Developers may want to modify the contents of UI Kit components or even replace most of them with a third party UI Library. Even in this case, it is advisable to always have your own wrapper around components.

<br />

For a complete list of components and detailed documentation, run [Storybook](/docs/tooling/storybook).
