# Circle CI

[CircleCI](https://circleci.com) is a CI/CD pipeline. It offers a great free plan allowing you to deploy your app today with no up front costs or credit cards.

<br />

This template comes with scripts and config to make deploying with Circle quick and easy.

<br />

See `.circleci/config.yml`

### Setup

### Environment variables

There are 4 required env variables for any particular deployment.

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_S3_REGION
S3_BUCKET_<env>
```

`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are AWS IAM credentials for your CircleCI machine user. Click here for instructions on creating an IAM user for CircleCI.

<br />

`AWS_S3_REGION` is the region you specified for your AWS S3 buckets. We assume you use the same region for all buckets.

<br />

`S3_BUCKET_<env>` is the bucket name for the particular environment. We recommend the following naming convention:

<br />
