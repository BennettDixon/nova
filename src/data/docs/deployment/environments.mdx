# Environments

For small teams, we recomend 4 environments. 1 local, and 3 deployment environments: `develop`, `staging`, and `production`.

<br />

Each environment has its own `.env` config file located in the top level `config` directory. [View on GitHub](https://github.com/yawnch/nova/tree/master/config).


### Example

**.env.production**
```
DEPLOY_ENV='production'
URL='nova.yawnch.com'

S3_BUCKET='my-production-bucket'
AWS_PROFILE='profile_name'

AMPLITUDE_API_KEY=
SENTRY_DSN=
```

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| S3_BUCKET | The name of the S3 bucket. Used only for deploys from your local machine. |
| AWS_PROFILE | The name of your machine's local AWS profile. Used only for deploys from your local machine. |
